Pomodio is a cute, frontend-only timer and habit tracker built with React.

Build with little bit of spagheti coding as part of my first univesity web tech project.

Key Features:

    ☁️ No Backend, No Database – All user data is saved securely to their own Google Drive via the Google Drive API, ensuring privacy and control.

    ⏱️ Pomodoro Timer – Helps users structure work into focused intervals with break sessions.

    📊 Progress Dashboard – Visualizes time spent on habits and productivity trends.



🔍 Why It’s Unique:

    This is a beautiful example of using Google API to the fullest.
    The application does not manage its own authentication or database - everything is handed over to Google API.
