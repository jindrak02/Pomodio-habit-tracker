# Pomodio habit tracker

This app was created as a part of college web technologies project. The app is running at https://pomodio.com/

Main goal of this frontend only single page app is to run a pomodoro timer, that saves statistic data on users google drive (therefore no database or backend is needed) and then display user a dashboard of his progress with those habits.
